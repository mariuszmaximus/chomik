# in this example we create a file of a name stored in a variable
# and we write to it

variable my_variable: string;
let variable my_variable=value string "t2.txt";

execute <create new output filestream <my_variable>>;
let variable the print target stream index = <the created stream index>;
execute <print "hello2">;    # now we print to the file t2.txt
