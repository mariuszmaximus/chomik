Experimental programming language.

It consists of the five commands:
- type definition
- variable declaration
- expand command
- assignment
- execution

Got used to the stack, passing parameters to functions, loops, classes, inheritence and the likes?
Forget it.
In chomik there are only families of variables. There are no loops - all iterations are implicit.
Code is nothing else but a built-in type. An infinite family of variables of type code is what we know as procedure.

Chomik allows polimorphism without the need of creating a class hierarchy.

The package contains also sdl_chomik, which is an example how to use the libchomik library in your own C++ projects.
The sdl_chomik is a chomik extension based on the SDL2 library.
